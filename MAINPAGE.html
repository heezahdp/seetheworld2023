<p>
In 2012, German meteorologist Alfred Wegener had a theory which is called "Continental Drift Theory". In the theory, it proposed the existence of a supercontinent called <em>Pangaea</em> , after he noticed the close correlation between the two coastlines of eastern South America and Western Africa, he proposd that at one time these two continents had been joined together, however it slowly drifted apart. He called the northern half <em>Laurasia</em> and the southern half <em>Gondwanaland</em>. These supercontinents slowly split further and their sections drift over the Earth's surface to form the present-day continents.
